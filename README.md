# My DSA Journey

A structured roadmap showcasing the Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) I’ve practiced. This repo is my personal space to learn, code, and revisit core logic fundamentals.


* Data structure:


1.Array & String
2.Linkedlist
3.Stack & Queue
4.Trees, heap, graph 

* Algorithm:


1.Sorting
Bubble, selection, insertion, merge, quick
2.Searching
Liner, Binary search
Dfs, Bfs in graph
3.Dynamic programig
